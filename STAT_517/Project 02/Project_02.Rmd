# Summary
This study developed linear regression models to effectively predict the weight of bananas based on external measurements. In order to develop the different models the techniques used were, determining significance of variables, elimination of variables and elimination of outliers. The models were then compared by ANOVA. This study concludes that the weight of the banana is dependent on the length and the radius of the banana. 


# Introduction
The weight of a banana is difficult to predict since it depends on density and volume, which are not easily measurable. In this study it was assumed that the density of the bananas remained consistent throughout the entire banana and that volume was approximately $V = \pi R^{2}L$, where $R$ was the radius of the body and $L$ was the curved length. As such we have $W = VD = \pi R^{2}LD$.

This report states the data collection methods, the different methods and techniques used for creating regression models, the analysis of the regression models and the recommendations for the best method to predict banana weight. For the purpose of this study, it is assumed $\alpha=0.05$ for all tests done.

# Data Collection
First a small sample set of 24 bananas were purchased from the Real Canadian Superstore. The weight, length, diameter and circumference were then calculated using a scale and a ruler. This data was recorded using an Excel spreadsheet for further analysis.  

```{r Sample Size, cache=TRUE}
rsquare_sim <- c()
for(i in 1:1000){
  banana_cor <- 
    banana_data %>%
    sample_n(10) %>% 
    select(
      Weight
      ,Radius
      ,Length
      # ,Circumference
    ) %>% 
    cor()
  
  xy_vec <- banana_cor[2:3, 1]
  C_mat <- banana_cor[2:3, 2:3]
  
  rsquare_sim[i] <- t(xy_vec) %*% solve(C_mat) %*% xy_vec
}
rsquare_sim %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  pander(caption = "Summary Statisitcs for Simulated R-Squared")
```

In order to determine the minimum sample size needed, random sample sizes of 10 were generated using radius and length as the predictors. The correlation of the random sample sizes were calculated and a matrix of the correlations were generated. The value of the squared population multiple correlation coefficients with two predictor variables was then calculated and determined to be approximately `r round(mean(rsquare_sim), 4)`. 

![(Knofczynski, 2007)](Images/Sample Size Table.png)

From this the minimum sample size required was then determined from the table from Figure 1, the minimum sample size was determined to be between 15 and 35, therefore the minimum number of bananas required was finalized at 24 bananas (Knofczynski, 2007).


# Analysis
## Preliminary Analysis
To begin the analysis the summary statistics of all predictor variables were calculated and recorded in Table 2. The summary statistics were used to highlight the data to obtain a general understanding of the spread for each predictor variable. 

Next graphs of the sampling distributions of the predictor variables were used to visualize the trends of the data in Figure 2. The graphs were examined for skewness and normality where, length appears to be highly skewed to the left, weight appears to be more normally distributed circumference and radius are very similarly distributed with potential bimodal distribution.

In Figure 3, correlation between weight and the predictor variables were produced. From the analysis of the graphs, circumference and radius appear to be much more highly correlated to weight than length.

```


## Initial Regression Models
To begin analysis, a model using all predictor variables was created. In this case the density of the banana is assumed to be a constant. In the following models all measured bananas were considered. 

Let:
$$
  W = \text{Weight (g), }
  L = \text{Length (mm), }
  R = \text{Radius (mm), }
  C = \text{Circumference (mm)}
$$
Then:
\begin{equation}
  \ln(W) = 
  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\ln(L) + \beta_{2}\ln(R) + \beta_{3}\ln(C) \implies
  W = 
  e^{\beta_{0}} \times L^{\beta_{1}} \times R^{\beta_{2}} \times C^{\beta_{3}}
\end{equation}

```{r Reg 01}
banana_reg_01 <-
  banana_data %>% 
  lm(
    Weight_log ~ Length_log + Radius_log + Circumference_log
    ,data = .
  )
pander(summary(banana_reg_01))
```

None of the predictor variables were found to be statistically significant. This is due to the high degree of collinearity exhibited between Radius and Circumference. As such, in the second model, the predictor variable, circumference, was removed. This is because $C=2\pi R$, leading to collinearity. This can also be seen by examining the correlation plot produced by the variables in Figure 4:
```{r Cor Plot}
banana_data %>%
  select(
    -c(
      ID
      ,Weight_log
      ,Radius_log
      ,Length_log
      ,Circumference_log
    )
  ) %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>%  
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  as.tibble() %>% 
  gather(
    key = Column
    ,value = Correlation
    ,-rowname
  ) %>% 
  rename(Row = rowname) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = Column
      ,y = Row
      ,fill = Correlation
    )
  ) +
  geom_raster() +
  scale_fill_distiller(
    type = "div"
    ,palette = "RdBu"
    ,limits = c(-1, 1)
  ) +
  labs(title= "Figure 4: Correlation Plot") +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)
    ,axis.title.x = element_blank()
    ,axis.title.y = element_blank()
    ,panel.grid = element_blank()
  )
```

The second model considered only the predictor variables length and radius:
\begin{equation}
  \ln(W) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\ln(L) + \beta_{2}\ln(R)
\end{equation}

This model is similar to the one described in the Introduction, with $e^{\beta_{0}} \approx \pi D$. as such, it'd be reasonable to expect it to perform reasonably well.

```{r Reg 02}
banana_reg_02 <-
  banana_data %>% 
  lm(
    Weight_log ~ Length_log + Radius_log
    ,data = .
  )
pander(summary(banana_reg_02))
```

The third model considered the predictor, length.
\begin{equation}
  \ln(W) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\ln(L)
\end{equation}

```{r Reg 03}
banana_reg_03 <-
  banana_data %>% 
  lm(
    Weight_log ~ Length_log
    ,data = .
  )
pander(summary(banana_reg_03))
```

The fourth model considered only one predictor, radius.
\begin{equation}
  \ln(W) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{2}\ln(R)
\end{equation}

```{r Reg 04}
banana_reg_04 <-
  banana_data %>% 
  lm(
    Weight_log ~ Radius_log
    ,data = .
  )
pander(summary(banana_reg_04))
```

ANOVAs were then done to determine if a statistically significant difference in levels of explained variation existed between the 4 models. 1st, 01 and 02 were compared, testing the effect of Circumference:
```{r ANOVA 01 vs 02}
pander(anova(banana_reg_02, banana_reg_01), caption = "Analysis of Variance Table: Model 01 vs. Model 02")
```

Based on the data, we failed to reject the null hypothesis of equal explained variance between the two models. As such, we believe the model 02 is more appropriate, as it is smaller and more parsimonious.

The following test compares models 02 and 03, testing the effect of Radius:
```{r ANOVA 02 vs 03}
pander(anova(banana_reg_03, banana_reg_02), caption = "Analysis of Variance Table: Model 02 vs. Model 03")
```

Based on the data, we rejected the null hypothesis of equal explained variance between the two models. As such, we believe the model 02 is more appropriate, as it does a better job at explaining the underlying variance in the data.

The following test compares models 02 and 03, testing the effect of Length:
```{r ANOVA 02 vs 04}
pander(anova(banana_reg_04, banana_reg_02), caption = "Analysis of Variance Table: Model 02 vs. Model 04")
```

Based on the data, we failed to reject the null hypothesis of equal explained variance between the two models. As such, we believe the model 04 is more appropriate, as it is smaller and more parsimonious.

From this, we found the most appropriate model was model 04, as it is the smallest model that explains an adequate amount of variance. This model being:
$$
  \ln(W) =
  0.3046 + 1.6690\ln(R) \implies
  W =
  e^{0.3046}R^{1.6690}
$$
This is an unexpected result, as it doesn't include the Length predictor, implying that the weight of a banana is purely a function of its radius. Due to this, further analysis was required.

## Removal of Outliers
Due to the surprising results obtained above, the choice to check for potential outliers was made. For this, model 02 was chosen, as we wished to examine the potential presence of outlier with respect to both Length and Radius, which model 04 would fail to accomplish.

```{r Outlier Check}
banana_resid_data <- 
  tibble(
    Predicted = predict(banana_reg_02)
    ,Actual = banana_data$Weight_log
    ,ID = banana_data$ID
    ,`Std Residuals` = stdres(banana_reg_02)
    ,Leverage = hatvalues(banana_reg_02)
  ) %>% 
  mutate(Residual = Actual - Predicted)

banana_resid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Predicted, y = `Std Residuals`)) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(yintercept = -2)
    ,linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(yintercept = 2)
    ,linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(
    data =
      banana_resid_data %>% 
      filter(abs(`Std Residuals`) >= 2)
    ,aes(label = ID)
    ,nudge_x = 0.005
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "loess"
    ,se = FALSE
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm"
    ,se = FALSE
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 5: Standardized Residuals vs. Predicted for Model 02"
    ,x = "Predicted (ln)"
    ,y = "Standardized Residual (ln)"
  )

banana_resid_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Leverage, y = `Std Residuals`)) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(yintercept = -2)
    ,linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_hline(
    aes(yintercept = 2)
    ,linetype = "dashed"
  ) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_text(
    data =
      banana_resid_data %>% 
      filter(abs(`Std Residuals`) >= 2)
    ,aes(label = ID)
    ,nudge_x = 0.02
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "loess"
    ,se = FALSE
  ) +
  geom_smooth(
    method = "lm"
    ,se = FALSE
  ) +
  labs(
    title = "Figure 6: Standardized Residuals vs. Leverage for Model 02"
    ,x = "Leverage (ln)"
    ,y = "Standardized Residual (ln)"
  )

banana_data %>% 
  inner_join(
    banana_resid_data %>% 
      filter(abs(`Std Residuals`) > 2)
    ,by = "ID"
  ) %>% 
  select(
    ID
    ,Weight
    ,Radius
    ,Length
    ,Circumference
    ,`Std Residuals`
    ,Leverage
  ) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Entries with a |Standardized Residual| >2")
```

By looking at values with $|\text{Std. Residual}|>2$, we can identify potential outliers. Then, by examining the leverage of those outliers we can make a determination of whether or not they are severely distorting the regression line from the true slope. Although both 6 and 11 have a large standardized residual, only 6 has a large leverage associated with it, and as such is excluded from the data set.


## Cross Validation
We then performed cross validation as described in the `caret` package on Equation (2). For this 10-fold cross validation was used, and the following regression output was produced, using the post-outlier data.
```{r CV DAAG, include=FALSE}
banana_data_post <-
  banana_data %>% 
    inner_join(
    banana_resid_data
    ,by = "ID"
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    !(abs(`Std Residuals`) > 2 & Leverage > 0.2)
  ) %>%
  select(
    -c(
      Predicted
      ,Actual
      ,`Std Residuals`
      ,Leverage
      ,Residual
    )
  )

banana_reg_cv <-
  banana_data_post %>%
  cv.lm(
    Weight_log ~ Length_log + Radius_log
    ,plotit = FALSE
  )
```

```{r CV caret}
banana_train_control <- trainControl(method = "cv", number = 10)
banana_caret_cv <- 
  train(
    Weight_log~.
    ,data = 
      banana_data_post %>% 
      select(Weight_log, Length_log, Radius_log)
    ,trControl = banana_train_control
    ,method = "lm"
  )
banana_caret_cv %>% 
  summary() %>% 
  pander()
```

This gives the model:
$$
  W =
  e^{-0.6249}L^{1.028}R^{1.957} =
  0.00193L^{1.028}R^{1.957} \implies
  D = \frac{0.00193}{\pi} =
  0.000615g/cm
$$

Which is very similar to that described in the Introduction section.

### Mean Error
The error was measured using the cross validated predictions, in both terms of the $\ln(W)$, and the $W$. Firstly, we found the Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Squared Error (MAE), and Mean Percent Absolute Error (MPAE). The residual was calculated as:
$$
  y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}
$$

```{r MAE}
mae_log <- 
  tibble(
    MSE =
      (
        banana_reg_cv %>% 
          transmute((Weight_log - cvpred)^2) %>% 
          sum()
      )/(as.numeric(count(banana_reg_cv)))
    ,MAE =
      (
        banana_reg_cv %>% 
          transmute(abs(Weight_log - cvpred)) %>% 
          sum()
      )/(as.numeric(count(banana_reg_cv)))
    ,MPAE =
      (
        banana_reg_cv %>% 
          transmute(abs((Weight_log - cvpred) / Weight_log)) %>% 
          sum()
      )/(as.numeric(count(banana_reg_cv)))
  )
kable(mae_log, caption = "Calculated Error Terms for Log CV Model")
```

For this, the residual term was put back into grams, and was calculated as following:

$$
  e^{y_{i}} - e^{\hat{y}_{i}}
$$

```{r MAE Log}
mae_regular <- 
  tibble(
    MSE =
      (
        banana_reg_cv %>% 
          transmute((Weight - exp(cvpred))^2) %>% 
          sum()
      )/(as.numeric(count(banana_reg_cv)))
    ,MAE =
      (
        banana_reg_cv %>% 
          transmute(abs(Weight - exp(cvpred))) %>% 
          sum()
      )/(as.numeric(count(banana_reg_cv)))
    ,MPAE =
      (
        banana_reg_cv %>% 
          transmute(abs((Weight - exp(cvpred)) / Weight)) %>% 
          sum()
      )/(as.numeric(count(banana_reg_cv)))
  )
kable(mae_regular, caption = "Calculated Error Terms for CV Model")
```



# Recommendations
Using the first set of data before the outlier was removed, it can be determined that the best way to predict the weight of a banana is by measuring the radius of the banana. The model that is then used for banana weight prediction is the following:
$$
  \ln(W) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\ln(R)
$$
$$
  \ln(W) = 0.3046 + 1.669\ln(R)
$$

After the removal of the outlier, the model that was determined to be the best predictor for banana weight was the following:
$$
\ln(W) = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\ln(R) + \beta_{2}\ln(l)
$$
